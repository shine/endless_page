Endless Page
===========

Are you still use will_paginate? OK. Try to imagine next situation: you want to find blog post written few weeks ago. There are from 2 up to 5 new posts in the blog every day. There are 10 posts on each page. What page should you click in the paging nav bar to find needed post?

Will_paginate answer: it depends...
Endless page answer: just scroll down

I have already wrote complete instructions for plugin user in my blog: http://bewhite.blogspot.com/2008/05/rails-endless-page-plugin.html
